# Description
As the name of these tools;

- Direct Boot To UEFI easily.
- Boot To Win Recovery.
- Nomal Reboot and Shutdown.

Enter to the UEFI without pressing F2 or Del on Keyboard. I thought you must have these Tools, especially for Overclockers.

Available with Advanced Reboot and (Only) ToUEFI.

This is just another way, there are some shortcut like this before.
