# Description
As the name of these tools
- Reboot To UEFI.
- Shutdown To UEFI.
- Boot To Win Recovery.
- Nomal Reboot and Shutdown.

Enter to the UEFI without pressing F2 or Del on Keyboard. I thought you must have these tools, especially for Overclockers.

This is just another way, there are some shortcuts like this before.

__Keep in mine! That these apps can only run under windows.__

# Usage

After run the app;

- Press __Enter__ for __RebootToUEFi__  or __ShutdownToUEFI__ ,

- Press __Tab__ to choose menu for __Advanced Reboot__ .
