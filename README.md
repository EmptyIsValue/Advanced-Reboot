# Description
As the name of these tools, it makes you acces Direct Boot To UEFI easily, Boot To Win Recovery, also avilable for Nomal Reboot and Shutdown.

You can imagine every go to the UEFI _without pressing F2 or Del on Keyboard_ . I thought you must have these Tools, especially for Overclockers.
Available with Advanced Reboot and (Only) ToU

This is just another way, there are some shortcut like this before.
